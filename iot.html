		 <p><b style="color:blue; font-size:20px;">The Internet of things (IoT)</b> describes the network of physical objects—“things”—that are
		     embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other
			 devices and systems over the Internet.<br><br>

             The definition of the Internet of things has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, real-time analytics, 
			 machine learning, commodity sensors, and embedded systems. Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks,
			 control systems, automation (including home and building automation), and others all contribute to enabling the Internet of things. 
			 In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining to the concept of the "smart home", 
			 including devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems and cameras, and other home appliances) 
			 that support one or more common ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones
			 and smart speakers.<br><br>

             There are a number of serious concerns about dangers in the growth of IoT, especially in the areas of privacy and security, 
			 and consequently industry and governmental moves to address these concerns have begun including the development of international standards.</p>

		   <hr style="margin-right:20px;">
		    <p>An IoT device will likely contain one or more sensors which it will use to collect data. Just what those sensors are
		     collecting will depend on the individual device and its task. Sensors inside industrial machinery might measure temperature
			 or pressure; a security camera might have a proximity sensor along with sound and video, while your home weather station will
			 probably be packing a humidity sensor. All this sensor data – and much, much more – will have to be sent somewhere. That means
			 IoT devices will need to transmit data and will do it via Wi-Fi, 4G, 5G and more.<br><br>

             Tech analyst IDC calculates that within five years IoT gadgets will be creating 79.4 zettabytes of data. Some of this IoT
			 data will be "small and bursty" says IDC – a quick update like a temperature reading from a sensor or a reading from a smart meter.
			 Other devices might create huge amounts of data traffic, like a video surveillance camera using computer vision.<br><br>

             IDC said the amount of data created by IoT devices will grow rapidly in the next few years. Most of the data is being generated 
			 by video surveillance, it said, but other industrial and medical uses will generate more data over time.<br><br>

             It said drones will also be a big driver of data creation using cameras. Looking further out, self-driving cars will also
			 generate vast amounts of rich sensor data including audio and video, as well as more specialised automotive sensor data.</p>

          <h2><u>IOT Evolution</u></h2>
		  <p style="font-size:18px;font-family:applechancery,cursive;">As the price of sensors and communications continue to drop, 
		     it becomes cost-effective to add more devices to the IoT – even if in some cases there's little obvious benefit to consumers.
			 Deployments are at an early stage; most companies that are engaging with the IoT are at the trial stage right now, largely 
			 because the necessary technology – sensor technology, 5G and machine-learning powered analytics – are still themselves at a
			 reasonably early stage of development. There are many competing platforms and standards and many different vendors, from device 
			 makers to software companies to network operators, want a slice of the pie. It's still not clear which of those will win out.
			 But without standards, and with security an ongoing issue, we are likely to see some more big IoT security mishaps 
			 in the next few years.<br><br>

             As the number of connected devices continues to rise, our living and working environments will become filled with smart
			 products – assuming we are willing to accept the security and privacy trade-offs. Some will welcome the new era of smart things.
			 Others will pine for the days when a chair was simply a chair.</p>

           <h2><u>Example of IOT Device</u></h2>
		  <p style="font-size:18px;font-family:applechancery,cursive;">Pretty much any physical object can be transformed into an 
		     IoT device if it can be connected to the internet to be controlled or communicate information.<br><br>

             A lightbulb that can be switched on using a smartphone app is an IoT device, as is a motion sensor or a smart thermostat 
			 in your office or a connected streetlight. An IoT device could be as fluffy as a child's toy or as serious as a driverless
			 truck. Some larger objects may themselves be filled with many smaller IoT components, such as a jet engine that's now filled
			 with thousands of sensors collecting and transmitting data back to make sure it is operating efficiently. At an even bigger scale, 
			 smart cities projects are filling entire regions with sensors to help us understand and control the environment.</p>

			 <hr>
			 <ul style="font-size:18px;">
			     <li><b style="color:navy;"><u>Smart Home:</u></b>IoT devices are a part of the larger concept of home automation,
           				 which can include lighting, heating and air conditioning, media and security systems and camera systems.
						 Long-term benefits could include energy savings by automatically ensuring lights and electronics are turned off
						 or by making the residents in the home aware of usage.<br>
                         A smart home or automated home could be based on a platform or hubs that control smart devices and appliances.</li>
			     <li><b style="color:navy;"><u>Energy Management:</u></b>Significant numbers of energy-consuming devices (e.g. lamps, 
				         household appliances, motors, pumps, etc.) already integrate Internet connectivity, which can allow them to 
						 communicate with utilities not only to balance power generation but also helps optimize the energy consumption as a whole.</li>
				 <li><b style="color:navy;"><u>Living Lab:</u></b>Another example of integrating the IoT is Living Lab which integrates
        				 and combines research and innovation process, establishing within a public-private-people-partnership.
						 There are currently 320 Living Labs that use the IoT to collaborate and share knowledge between stakeholders
						 to co-create innovative and technological products.</li>
						 </ul>

	     <div class="col-sm-6">
		 	 <ul style="font-size:18px;">
			     <li><b style="color:navy;"><u>Metropolitan Scale Deployments:</u></b>There are several planned or ongoing large-scale 
				         deployments of the IoT, to enable better management of cities and systems. For example, Songdo, South Korea, the 
						 first of its kind fully equipped and wired smart city, is gradually being built, with approximately 70 percent 
						 of the business district completed as of June 2018. Much of the city is planned to be wired and automated, with
						 little or no human intervention</li>
			     <li><b style="color:navy;"><u>Agriculture:</u></b>There are numerous IoT applications in farming such as collecting
        				 data on temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed, pest infestation, and soil content. This data can be used 
						 to automate farming techniques, take informed decisions to improve quality and quantity, minimize risk and waste,
						 and reduce effort required to manage crops.</li>
			     <li><b style="color:navy;"><u>Environmental monitoring:</u></b>Environmental monitoring applications of the IoT typically
        				 use sensors to assist in environmental protection[87] by monitoring air or water quality, atmospheric or soil 
						 conditions, and can even include areas like monitoring the movements of wildlife and their habitats.</li>
			     <li><b style="color:navy;"><u>Internet of Battlefield Things:</u></b>The Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) is a project 
				         initiated and executed by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) that focuses on the basic science related to IoT
						 that enhance the capabilities of Army soldiers. In 2017, ARL launched the Internet of Battlefield Things Collaborative
						 Research Alliance (IoBT-CRA), establishing a working collaboration between industry, university, and Army researchers 
						 to advance the theoretical foundations of IoT technologies and their applications to Army operations.</li>
