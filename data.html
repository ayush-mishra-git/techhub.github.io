		 <p><b style="color:blue; font-size:20px;">Data science </b>is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, 
		     algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data. Data science is related to 
			 data mining, machine learning and big data.</p>

          <p>Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze
		     actual phenomena" with data. It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics,
			 statistics, computer science, domain knowledge and information science. Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a 
			 "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science
			 is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge.</p>
			 
		   <p>Data science is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting knowledge from data sets, which are typically large. The field 
		      encompasses analysis, preparing data for analysis, and presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in an organization.
			  As such, it incorporates skills from computer science, mathematics, statistics, information visualization, graphic design, 
			  complex systems, communication and business. Statistician Nathan Yau, drawing on Ben Fry, also links data science to 
			  human-computer interaction: users should be able to intuitively control and explore data. In 2015, the American Statistical
			  Association identified database management, statistics and machine learning, and distributed and parallel systems as the three
			  emerging foundational professional communities.</p>

	       <hr style="margin-right:20px;">
		   
		   <p>Data science involves a plethora of disciplines and expertise areas to produce a holistic, thorough and refined look
		     into raw data.<b style="color:red;"> Data scientists must be skilled in everything from data engineering, math, statistics, advanced computing
			 and visualizations </b>to be able to effectively shift through muddled masses of information and communicate only the most vital
			 bits that will help drive innovation and efficiency.</p>

            <p>Data scientists also rely heavily on artificial intelligence, especially its subfields of machine learning and deep learning,
			  to create models and make predictions using algorithms and other techniques.</p>
			 
            <p>Data science generally has a five-stage life cycle that consists of:</p>
			
                <ol>				
                 <li><b style="color:blue">Capture</b>: Data acquisition, data entry, signal reception, data extraction.</li>
                 <li><b style="color:blue"> Maintain</b>: Data warehousing, data cleansing, data staging, data processing, data architecture.</li>
                 <li><b style="color:blue">Process</b>: Data mining, clustering/classification, data modeling, data summarization.</li>
                 <li><b style="color:blue">Communicate</b>: Data reporting, data visualization, business intelligence, decision making.</li>
				 <li><b style="color:blue">Analyze</b>: Exploratory/confirmatory, predictive analysis, regression, text mining, qualitative analysis</li>			 
		      </ol>	
			  
			  <br>
			  <h3 style="color:lightseagreen;"><u>What does a Data Scientist do?</u></h3>
                 <p>A data scientist’s role will vary based on their industry and the goals of their organization. If you choose to pursue 
				     this wide-ranging career, you could be responsible for anything from improving an app by analyzing in-depth customer 
					 research, to predicting the outcomes of a new drug through machine learning.</p>

                 <p>But while the end goal varies, the basic steps to get there are the same. Here are the tasks that just about any data
     				 scientist will perform:</p>
					 <ul>
                         <li style="color:crimson;">Clean and analyze data.</li>
                         <li style="color:crimson;">Present insights to stakeholders</li>
                         <li style="color:crimson;">Back up company decisions with hard data</li>
                         <li style="color:crimson;">Identify and predict patterns in behavior, preferences and trends</li>	
                      </ul>

                 <p><b style="color:blue;">Matt Francsis</b>, a Thinkful graduate who is now working as a Data Scientist for an analytics firm, discovers insights
				     for clients in a variety of industries. Sometimes that means evaluating product performance for a pharmaceutical company;
					 other times he’s interpreting sensory data for a company that makes wearable fitness trackers.</p>					  
                 <h3 style="font-family:applechancery,cursive; color:lightseagreen">“A lot of my work is pretty variable: looking at experimental design, data analysis, data visualization and also feature

			     an office or telecommuting, you’ll spend several hours a day in front of a screen. But the findings you reveal through
				 your analyses and algorithms will have a tangible impact for your company, your customers, and possibly the world.</h3>

             <p style="font-size:18px;">Data scientists bring a lot of value to their organizations, and they’re rewarded for their expertise in the form of
			     high pay and excellent benefits. According to indeed.com, many full-time data scientists enjoy unlimited paid time off, 
				 food provided on-site and stock options. That’s in addition to the full suite of health coverage and 401(k) benefits.</p>

             <p style="font-size:18px;">If you commit to a career in data science, you’ll likely find yourself in high-level roles. Your insights will drive major 
			     company decisions, and that means a certain amount of stress and accountability. But you can also expect a lot of personal
				 fulfillment and six-figure salaries.</p>

                  <h2>Key Skills Of a Data Scientist</h2>
				  <hr>
                    <p style="font-size:18px;">Data science is a highly specialized profession that requires a variety of technical abilities. But it also takes 
					     interpersonal skills to excel: after all, you need to translate your equations into clear language in order to 
						 persuade the leadership team.<br>  
                     If you have the following foundational skills, you’ll make an excellent data science candidate.</p>
					 <br>
					 <p style="font-size:18px;"><b style="color:darkslateblue;"><u>Hard skills:</u></b> Prepare yourself for some pretty intense math,
					     like advanced statistics, linear algebra and calculus. Every data scientist also relies on coding knowledge to
						 interpret large datasets, so you’ll<i style="color:red"> need to learn SQL and Python.</i> And in order to enter this
						 field, you need to be an expert at data organization and cleaning. If you’re brand new to the data scene, start by 
						 studying data analysis first.<br>

                         <b style="color:darkslateblue;"><u>Soft skills:</u></b> You’ll need to communicate your findings visually and verbally in a
						     way that makes sense to stakeholders. As a data scientist, you’ll have to perfect the art of taking complex information 
							 and pulling out the insights that matter most to business leaders. In addition to clear communication, a keen eye 
							 for detail combined with critical thinking skills will help you solve business challenges with equations and algorithms.
							 <br>
							 <br>

                         Most importantly, this field is ideal for someone who loves learning. Data science is constantly evolving, so you’ll need to 
						 adapt to new tools and technologies over the course of your career. It’s an ongoing challenge that many will find 
						 exciting and invigorating.</p>
