	  <p><b style="color:blue; font-size:20px;">Artificial intelligence (AI)</b>, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence
	     displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and
		 takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines
		 (or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".</p>
		 
	  <p>As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known
	     as the AI effect. A quip in Tesler's Theorem says "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet." For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded
		 from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology. Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding 
		 human speech, competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go), autonomously operating cars, intelligent routing in content
		 delivery networks, and military simulations.</p>

		      <p>Computer science defines AI research as the study of "intelligent agents":<b style="color:red;"> any device that perceives its environment and takes actions
			     that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.</b> A more elaborate definition characterizes AI as "a system's ability to correctly
				 interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation."</p>
	  
	           <p>A typical AI analyzes its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success. An AI's intended utility function (or goal)
			     can be simple ("1 if the AI wins a game of Go, 0 otherwise") or complex ("Perform actions mathematically similar to ones that succeeded in the past").
				 Goals can be explicitly defined or induced. If the AI is programmed for "reinforcement learning", goals can be implicitly induced by rewarding 
				 some types of behavior or punishing others. Alternatively, an evolutionary system can induce goals by using a "fitness function" to mutate and
				 preferentially replicate high-scoring AI systems, similar to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food.
				 Some AI systems, such as nearest-neighbor, instead of reason by analogy, these systems are not generally given goals, except to the degree that 
				 goals are implicit in their training data. Such systems can still be benchmarked if the non-goal system is framed as a system whose "goal" is to 
				 successfully accomplish its narrow classification task.</p>
				
               <p>AI often revolves around the use of algorithms. An algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions that a mechanical computer can execute.
			     A complex algorithm is often built on top of other, simpler, algorithms. A simple example of an algorithm is the following (optimal for first player)
   				 recipe for play at tic-tac-toe:</p>

               <p style="color:blue;">1.If someone has a "threat" (that is, two in a row), take the remaining square. Otherwise,<br>
                  2.if a move "forks" to create two threats at once, play that move. Otherwise,<br>
                  3.take the center square if it is free. Otherwise,<br>
                  4.if your opponent has played in a corner, take the opposite corner. Otherwise,<br>
                  5.take an empty corner if one exists. Otherwise,<br>
                  6.take any empty square</p>

	<h3 style="color:black;">Artificial intelligence (AI) makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs and perform
    	human-like tasks. Most AI examples that you hear about today – from chess-playing computers to self-driving cars – rely heavily on deep learning
		and natural language processing. Using these technologies, computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks by processing large amounts of data 
		and recognizing patterns in the data.</h3>
