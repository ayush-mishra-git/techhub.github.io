		 <p><b style="color:blue; font-size:20px;">Mobile app development</b> is the act or process by which a mobile app is developed for mobile devices,
		     such as personal digital assistants, enterprise digital assistants or mobile phones. These applications can be pre-installed on phones during
			 manufacturing platforms, or delivered as web applications using server-side or client-side processing (e.g., JavaScript) to provide an "application-like"
			 experience within a Web browser. Application software developers also must consider a long array of screen sizes, hardware specifications, and configurations 
			 because of intense competition in mobile software and changes within each of the platforms. Mobile app development has been steadily growing, in revenues
			 and jobs created. A 2013 analyst report estimates there are 529,000 direct app economy jobs within the EU then 28 members (including the UK), 60 percent 
			 of which are mobile app developers.</p>
			 
		<p>As part of the development process, mobile user interface (UI) design is also essential in the creation of mobile apps. Mobile UI considers constraints,
		     contexts, screen, input, and mobility as outlines for design. The user is often the focus of interaction with their device, and the interface entails 
			 components of both hardware and software. User input allows for the users to manipulate a system, and device's output allows the system to indicate 
			 the effects of the users' manipulation. Mobile UI design constraints include limited attention and form factors, such as a mobile device's screen size
			 for a user's hand(s). Mobile UI contexts signal cues from user activity, such as location and scheduling that can be shown from user interactions within 
			 a mobile app. Overall, mobile UI design's goal is mainly for an understandable, user-friendly interface. The UI of mobile apps should: consider users' 
			 limited attention, minimize keystrokes, and be task-oriented with a minimum set of functions. This functionality is supported by mobile enterprise application 
			 platforms or integrated development environments (IDEs).</p>
			 
		<p>Mobile UIs, or front-ends, rely on mobile back-ends to support access to enterprise systems. The mobile back-end facilitates data routing, security,
		     authentication, authorization, working off-line, and service orchestration. This functionality is supported by a mix of middleware components 
			 including mobile app server, mobile backend as a service (MBaaS), and service-oriented architecture (SOA) infrastructure.</p>

			<h3><b><u>Front-end development tools</u></b></h3> 
			<p>Front-end development tools are focused on the user interface and user experience (UI-UX) and provide the following abilities:</p>
			
			<ul>
			   <li>UI design tools</li>
			   <li>SDKs to access device features</li>
			   <li>Cross-platform accommodations/support</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3><b><u>Back-end servers</u></b></h3>
			<p>Back-end tools pick up where the front-end tools leave off, and provide a set of reusable services that are centrally managed and controlled
			     and provide the following abilities:</p>
				 
			<ul>
			     <li>Integration with back-end systems</li>
			     <li>User authentication-authorization</li>
			     <li>Data services</li>
                 <li>Reusable business logic</li>
			</ul>	 
			
			<h3><b><u>Security add-on layers</u></b></h3>
			<p>With bring your own device (BYOD) becoming the norm within more enterprises, IT departments often need stop-gap, tactical solutions that layer 
			  atop existing apps, phones, and platform component. Features include:</p>
	 
	        <ul>
			     <li>App wrapping for security</li>
			     <li>Data encryption</li>
			     <li>Client actions</li>
			     <li>Reporting and statistics</li>

			     <h4><b>Mobility Matters</b></h4>
				 <p>Nearly 75% of all large organizations reported an increase in productivity after adopting the enterprise mobility paradigm.
				     A recent report on workforces revealed that mobile devices saved field staff an average of 240 hours a year as a
					 result of being seamlessly connected to their workplaces.</p>

                 <p>This statistic drives home the fact that mobile application development has the utmost relevance today.
				     Simply put, it's the development of software modules for use on mobile platforms, either independently or 
					 as part of a larger ecosystem.</p>

			 <h4><b>Why go mobile?</b></h4>
			 <p>Mobile devices permit employees to complete tasks on the go, which is why enterprise mobility is such a popular concept. 
			     In many cases, apps also act as a medium between a business and its customers, making them indispensable tools for building
				 customer relationships.</p>

             <p>However, conventional mobile app development is a rigorous and effort-intensive process, requiring considerable time
			     and money to be spent on individual apps.</p>

             <p>Enter low-code mobile app development platforms.</p>
